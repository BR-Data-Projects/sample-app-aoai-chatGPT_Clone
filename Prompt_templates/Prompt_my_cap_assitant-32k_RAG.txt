{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, I'm getting not the same coffee amount as usual?"},
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you for writing and for your order. We are sorry you are having troubles with our product.

It seems that using coffee grounds to an espresso setting may be the reason for the issue you are experiencing. Try to use less finely ground coffee and/or compress the coffee not too much, so the water and coffee can flow through into the cup. 

Let us know if this is helping. 

Take care, 
Your My-Cap Team"}
