Post-sales,Product Instruction,"Just one question, the foils I have are significantly larger than the Vertuo pods. Did I possibly order the wrong size? It's not a big deal, I can just trim them. I'm just checking because I want to order some caps so I can make several pods at once. ","The foils you ordered should fit the Nespresso Vertuo Pods, as our My-Cap foils have one standard size.  The foils need to be wrapped around the rim to seal the capsule."
Pre-sales,Product Details,before i buy can you tell me what kind of paper these are cut from? i have some allergies i just wanted to make sure. Also do you cut these yourself? Thanks so much.,"Hello there, 

Thank you for writing to us and we sincerely apologize for the delay in response. Our paper filters are made of lightweight, two phase heatsealable tissue. The tissue has high wet strength combined with neutral odor and flavor characteristics making it a highly acceptable media for bagging tea or coffee. 

We hope this helps and we've gotten great feedback from customers over the years. 

Warm regards,

Post-sales,Product Instruction,"Hi, I bought the foil lids for the Vertuo line. Generally they work fine, but why are they so big? Why not make them so they correctly fit the pods? I'd like to be able to fill a week's worth of pods at one time, but since these things are so big I have no confidence they won't leak or go stale.","Thank you for writing to us and we're sorry to hear that you're having issues. Our foils are designed so that they provide air-tight, well sealed capsules so you can make as many in advance as you want. A recommendation we would suggest would be to center the foil on top of the capsule and make sure to depress the inside edge of the foil on the capsule. And then press the foil down around the edges.

We hope this helps!

Warm regards,

Pre-sales,Product choice,"Please advise as to what method would be better to seal the reuse cap? I am trying to avoid grinds in coffee and any mess that may occur.
1. Paper filters for use with My-Capâ„¢ Cap or
2. Foils only which allow you to make your own capsules that are completely sealed?","Thank you for writing to us. We would suggest trying our My-Cap Sampler to help you find what you like best. Our quality foil provides an air-tight, well-sealed capsule that offers clean puncture holes and no foil tears. Please note that our My-Cap Filters are designed to be used with the My-Cap Caps (grey plastic or silicone). The filters help reduce the particulates in the coffee. The caps and filters together allow you to fill your own capsules. Hope this helps! Warm regards, Your My-Cap Team"
Pre-sales,Discount,Hi! I would love to be able to fill more discs at one time but $17 each holds me back. What kind of a discount do you offer for multiple discs?,"Hi there,
