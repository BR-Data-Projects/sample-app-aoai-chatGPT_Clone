I have narrowed my search down to your company from the many other foreign companies that are offering similar systems, since you are an American company and you created this whole concept. That is why I assumed I could speak with someone in your sales department to help me figure this out! For example, why would I want the Sampler with 3 different solutions when I only want to try the most effective and environment friendly option that you recommend (I can't find any recommendations anywhere on your site!) I don't even mind calling you-if you have phones in your department-as it will probably be more effective than emailing back and forth until I figure out what I need to give it a try. Like do I get just the capsule holder by itself, or do I need caps to go with it, and which ones-foil, silicone, or paper, and if I just get the Cap & Lid, how often can I reuse my old capsules-forever? And do I need a separate holder and scoop-which I don't see sold separately. Sorry for being so annoying, but it's a little overwhelming for someone like myself-who is usually reasonably intelligent regarding most aspects of life today-but who is new to this concept-as none of my Nespresso friends are using this more cost efficient, and I hope more environment friendly system. Any advice you can offer in whatever manner works for you will be greatly appreciated, thanks!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you for writing to us. We are a small business so we won't be able to provide support over the phone. We apologize for the inconvenience. With that said, may you tell us what machine you have? That would help narrow down the product selection. We have products that go well with different machines. Thank you! Your My-Cap Team"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks, I have the standard Vertuo coffee machine by De'longhi, and I appreciate your assistance here."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you for letting us know. This helps a lot! We recommend trying the My-Cap Sampler for customers who would like to try different ways to make coffee. Our sampler is an economical and fun way to explore new reusable capsule options. Within the package, are four total reusable solutions. Find the one(s) that you like best and come back to re-order those specific products. Here are the different reusable capsule options which is also outlined in our product's description on the site as well:\n1. Our reusable silicone cap is used on a pod for an immediate cup of coffee. Add an included filter under the cap to prevent coffee grounds from entering the brew, and the result is an exceptional cup of coffee, crema or espresso.\n2. The reusable plastic cap works the same way as the reusable silicone caps, but is only compatible with the Vertuo by Breville Brewer and the Vertuo Evoluo Brewer. It is not recommended for machines with an automatic closing mechanism.\n3. My-Cap\u2019s reusable silicone lids are great for preparing pods in advance. This air-tight lid keeps coffee grounds fresh and ready for use for 7-14 days. Add a filter, cap and lid, then remove the lid and place the pod in the machine when ready to begin brewing.\n4. Save money by easily creating your own coffee pods with My-Cap foils. Simply adhere a My-Cap foil to the top of a pod, gently press the foil along the edges and the pod is ready to use. Our quality foil provides an air-tight, well-sealed capsule that offers clean puncture holes and no foil tears.\n\nWe hope this provides more clarity on our different options for Nespresso Vertuo machines. If you prefer one method over another, you can also purchase them on their own on our site under the section for Vertuo machines here (https://www.my-cap.com/collections/nespresso-vertuoline).\n\nWarm regards,\nYour My-Cap Team"}]}
